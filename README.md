## Plugins ##

See the HTML pages in this repository for examples of how to use these plugins.

### arcGisMap ###

This plugin provides a jQuery widget for creating a map using the ArcGIS JavaScript API.

#### Features ####

* By default, the map will resize when the page resizes.

### layerSorter ###

This widget allows the user to reorder the layers in the map.

### extentSelect ###

This widget allows the user to select from a list of predefined extents.  When an extent is selected, the map is zoomed to that extent.
